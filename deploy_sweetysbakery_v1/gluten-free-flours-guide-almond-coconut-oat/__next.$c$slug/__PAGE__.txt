        <p>Transitioning to <strong>gluten-free baking</strong> opens up a world of new textures and flavors. However, swapping out wheat flour isn't a 1:1 ratio. Understanding your flours is the first step to success.</p>
        
        <h3>Almond Flour</h3>
        <p>Made from blanched almonds, this flour adds incredible moisture and a nutty flavor. It's high in fat and low in carbs, making it perfect for <strong>keto baking</strong>. It works best in cakes, cookies, and tart crusts but lacks binding power, so it's often paired with egg whites or gums.</p>

        <h3>Coconut Flour</h3>
        <p>The sponge of the flour world! Coconut flour absorbs liquid like crazy. You generally only need 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coconut flour to replace 1 cup of regular flour, and you'll need significantly more eggs or liquid to prevent a dry, crumbly mess.</p>

        <h3>Oat Flour</h3>
        <p>A great whole-grain option that mimics the fluffiness of wheat flour. Certified <strong>gluten-free oat flour</strong> is essential for safety. It has a mild, sweet flavor ideal for pancakes, muffins, and quick breads.</p>0:{"buildId":"LIXo5cIISO3I13sKH-iRx","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"activeTool":"baking-blog","activePost":{"id":104,"slug":"gluten-free-flours-guide-almond-coconut-oat","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Gluten-Free Flours: Almond, Coconut, & Oat","excerpt":"Confused by gluten-free flour options?
