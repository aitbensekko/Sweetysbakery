3:T408,<h2>The Ultimate Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2><p>There is nothing quite like a warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie. This recipe has been tested and perfected to ensure the <strong>ultimate chewy texture</strong>. Forget cakey or dry cookies; these are rich, buttery, and packed with chocolate.</p><h3>Why This Recipe Works</h3><p>The secret to the chewiness is using <strong>melted butter</strong> instead of softened. This creates a denser, fudgier cookie. We also use more brown sugar than white sugar for moisture and that delicious caramel flavor. Finally, an extra egg yolk adds richness and tenderness.</p><h3>Key Ingredients</h3><ul><li><strong>Melted Butter:</strong> For chewiness.</li><li><strong>Brown Sugar:</strong> For moisture and flavor.</li><li><strong>Cornstarch:</strong> A secret ingredient for softness.</li><li><strong>Extra Egg Yolk:</strong> For richness.</li></ul><p>Bake these for just 11-12 minutes. They will look underbaked, but they firm up as they cool, leaving you with the perfect soft center.</p>0:{"buildId":"LIXo5cIISO3I13sKH-iRx","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"activeTool":"recipe-index","activePost":{"id":101,"type":"recipe","slug":"chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies","title":"The Ultimate Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies | Sweety's Bakery","excerpt":"These are the softest, chewiest chocolate chip cookies you will ever make.
