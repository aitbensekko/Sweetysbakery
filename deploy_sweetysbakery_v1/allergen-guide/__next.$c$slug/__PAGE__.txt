The scientific basis of allergen management <a href="/role-of-eggs-in-baking" style="color: #E65A88; text-decoration: underline;">in baking</a> involves precise identification of these allergenic proteins (e.g., gluten in wheat, casein in dairy, ovalbumin in egg) and rigorous cross-contamination prevention.
