        <p>Gluten provides the elastic network that traps gas bubbles. Without it, we need new strategies to get that loft.</p>

        <h3>Hydration is Key</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free dough should be much wetter than traditional dough—more like a thick batter. Don't be tempted to add more flour; moisture is what creates the steam for lift.</p>

        <h3>The Power of Psyllium Husk</h3>
        <p>Xanthan gum is common, but <strong>psyllium husk powder</strong> is the game changer for bread. It creates a gel-like structure that allows the dough to be kneaded and shaped, providing that chewy, bread-like texture.</p>

        <h3>Longer Proofing</h3>
        <p>Give your yeast time and warmth. GF flours don't offer food for yeast as readily as wheat, so a warm, humid rising environment is crucial.</p>0:{"buildId":"LIXo5cIISO3I13sKH-iRx","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"activeTool":"baking-blog","activePost":{"id":107,"slug":"secrets-fluffy-gluten-free-bread","title":"Secrets to Baking Soft, Fluffy Gluten-Free Bread","excerpt":"Say goodbye to dense, brick-like loaves.
