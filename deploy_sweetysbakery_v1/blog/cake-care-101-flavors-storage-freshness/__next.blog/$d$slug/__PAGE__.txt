        <p>While vanilla and chocolate are timeless, the <strong>cake flavors people love</strong> are expanding. Palates are becoming more adventurous. Current favorites include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Salted Caramel:</strong> The perfect balance of sweet and salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon Elderflower:</strong> Made famous by royalty, this light, floral flavor is perfect for spring and summer.</li>
            <li><strong>Pistachio & Rose:</strong> A Middle Eastern inspired combination that is nutty, floral, and sophisticated.</li>
            <li><strong>Funfetti:</strong> Nostalgia in a slice! The colorful sprinkles bring joy to adults and kids alike.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="/how-to-store-cakes-properly" style="color: #E65A88; text-decoration: underline;">How to Store Cakes Properly</a></h3>
        <p>Nothing is worse than a dry, stale cake. Knowing <strong>how to store cakes properly</strong> is essential for maintaining that fresh-baked taste.</p>
        
        <h4>Unfrosted Cakes</h4>
        <p>Wrap layers tightly in plastic wrap. For best results, wrap them while they are still slightly warm (not hot!) to trap moisture, then freeze them. They can stay fresh in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h4>Frosted Cakes</h4>
        <p>Buttercream acts as a natural seal. A fully frosted cake can sit at room temperature for 2-3 days (unless it has a perishable filling like custard or fresh fruit). For longer storage, chill it in the fridge to set the frosting, then loosely wrap in plastic to prevent it from absorbing fridge odors.</p>

        <h4>Cut Cakes</h4>
        <p>Once cut, the exposed sponge will dry out quickly. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly against the cut surface, or use a slice of bread attached with toothpicks to "cap" the exposed area—the bread will dry out, but the cake will stay moist!</p>
