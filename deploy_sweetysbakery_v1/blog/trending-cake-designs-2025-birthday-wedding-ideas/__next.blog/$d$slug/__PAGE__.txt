        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vintage "Lambeth" Piping:</strong> Intricate, over-the-top piping reminiscent of Victorian era cakes is making a huge comeback. Think pastel colors, frills, and cherries on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Burn-Away Cakes:</strong> The viral sensation where a top layer of wafer paper is burned away to reveal an image underneath. Perfect for gender reveals or surprise messages!</li>
            <li><strong>Hyper-Realistic Textures:</strong> Cakes that look like other objects (purses, shoes, fast food) continue to fascinate and confuse the senses.</li>
            <li><strong>Botanical Pressed Flowers:</strong> Using edible, organic pressed flowers for a whimsical, cottage-core aesthetic.</li>
        </ul>
