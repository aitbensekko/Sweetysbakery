        <h3>1. Dessert Shooters: Layers of Flavor</h3>
        <p>These are essentially deconstructed cakes or pies served in small shot glasses or plastic verrines.
        <br><strong>Why they work:</strong> They look elegant, control portions, and are completely mess-free.
        <br><strong>Flavor Combos:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strawberry Shortcake:</strong> Layers of vanilla cake cubes, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Lime Pie:</strong> Graham cracker crumbs, lime curd, and meringue.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate Mousse:</strong> Dark chocolate mousse, Oreo crumbs, and chocolate shavings.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>2. The Macaron Tower</h3>
        <p>Nothing says "fancy" like a French macaron. Instead of a flat platter, arrange them on a cone-shaped tower.
        <br><strong>Pros:</strong> They are naturally gluten-free (usually), come in every color imaginable to match your theme, and are the perfect two-bite treat.
        <br><strong>Flavors:</strong> Mix classics like pistachio and raspberry with fun ones like birthday cake or salted caramel.</p>

        <h3>3. Mini Tartlets</h3>
        <p>You can buy high-quality pre-made tart shells to save time, then fill them with homemade fillings.
        <br><strong>Fillings:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lemon Curd:</strong> Top with a single raspberry or a burnt meringue kiss.</li>
            <li><strong>Ganache:</strong> Dark chocolate ganache topped with sea salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Pastry Cream:</strong> Vanilla custard topped with glazed fruit (fruit tart).</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>4. Interactive Dessert Stations</h3>
        <p>Let your guests do the work! Interactive stations are a huge trend because they provide entertainment and food simultaneously.
        <br><strong>Donut Wall:</strong> A pegboard holding donuts. It's a great photo backdrop.
        <br><strong>S'mores Bar:</strong> If you have an outdoor fire pit (or small tabletop burners), set out gourmet marshmallows, different types of chocolate (Reese's, dark, milk), and graham crackers.
        <br><strong>Ice Cream Sundae Bar:</strong> Pre-scoop ice cream into balls and freeze them on a tray so they are ready to go. Set out bowls of sprinkles, hot fudge, caramel, nuts, and cherries.</p>

        <h3>5. Cake Pops and Truffles</h3>
        <p>Cake on a stick is still a party favorite, especially for kids.
        <br><strong>The Hack:</strong> Use leftover cake scraps mixed with frosting to make the center. Dip in colored candy melts.
        <br><strong>Grown-up Version:</strong> Make "Cake Truffles" (no stick) and roll them in cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or freeze-dried raspberry dust for a sophisticated look.</p>

        <h3>6. Dessert Charcuterie Boards</h3>
        <p>The "Butter Board" trend has evolved into the dessert board.
        <br><strong>What to include:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dips:</strong> Chocolate hummus, caramel sauce, cream cheese dip.</li>
            <li><strong>Dippers:</strong> Pretzels, strawberries, apple slices, shortbread cookies, wafers.</li>
            <li><strong>Fillers:</strong> Popcorn, chocolate covered almonds, marshmallows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It creates a communal grazing experience that encourages conversation.</p>

        <p>Remember, the goal is to have fun. Choose desserts that can be made ahead of time so you aren't stuck in the kitchen while your guests are partying!</p>
