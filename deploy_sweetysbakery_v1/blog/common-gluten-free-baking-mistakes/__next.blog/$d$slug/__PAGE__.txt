Here is how to avoid the pitfalls.</p>\n\n        <h3>1. Measuring by Volume</h3>\n        <p>GF flours settle more than wheat flour. Always <strong>weigh your ingredients</strong> in grams for accuracy. A cup of almond flour weighs very different from a cup of rice flour.</p>\n\n        <h3>2. Skipping the Rest Period</h3>\n        <p>GF batters need to rest for 15-30 minutes before baking. This hydrates the starches and prevents a gritty texture.</p>\n\n        <h3>3. Over-mixing... or Under-mixing?</h3>\n        <p>Unlike wheat batter, you can't really over-mix GF batter (no gluten to toughen!). In fact, mixing longer helps structure-building gums like xanthan gum to activate.</p>"}}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/91ccc9d5ed17d3c2.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-1",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/9e48a53e8f66a180.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-2",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/eeef5bd7e2739375.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-3",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/22350ad4a0dbb174.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-4",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/736ba9a76940971c.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
