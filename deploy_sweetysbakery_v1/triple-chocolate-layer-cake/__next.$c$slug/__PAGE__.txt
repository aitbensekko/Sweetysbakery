This triple chocolate layer cake is incredibly moist, has a deep chocolate flavor, and is covered in a decadent chocolate buttercream.</p><h3>The Secret to Moist Cake</h3><p>This recipe uses both <strong>buttermilk</strong> and <strong>hot coffee</strong>. The acidity in the buttermilk tenderizes the crumb, while the hot coffee blooms the cocoa powder, intensifying the chocolate flavor without making the cake taste like coffee.</p><h3>Assembly Tips</h3><p>Make sure your cake layers are completely cool before frosting. I recommend chilling them in the fridge for 30 minutes to make them easier to handle. Use a serrated knife to level the tops if they domed during baking.</p>"}}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/91ccc9d5ed17d3c2.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-1",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/9e48a53e8f66a180.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-2",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/eeef5bd7e2739375.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-3",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/22350ad4a0dbb174.js","async":true}],["$","script","script-4",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/736ba9a76940971c.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
