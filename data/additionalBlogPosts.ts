        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vintage "Lambeth" Piping:</strong> Intricate, over-the-top piping reminiscent of Victorian era cakes is making a huge comeback. Think pastel colors, frills, and cherries on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Burn-Away Cakes:</strong> The viral sensation where a top layer of wafer paper is burned away to reveal an image underneath. Perfect for gender reveals or surprise messages!</li>
            <li><strong>Hyper-Realistic Textures:</strong> Cakes that look like other objects (purses, shoes, fast food) continue to fascinate and confuse the senses.</li>
            <li><strong>Botanical Pressed Flowers:</strong> Using edible, organic pressed flowers for a whimsical, cottage-core aesthetic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="/how-to-choose-a-wedding-cake" style="color: #E65A88; text-decoration: underline;">How to Choose a Wedding Cake</a> in 2025</h3>
        <p>Planning a wedding? Knowing <strong>how to choose a wedding cake</strong> can be overwhelming. In 2025, couples are opting for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Separated Tiers:</strong> Using clear acrylic separators filled with flowers or lights to create height and drama.</li>
            <li><strong>Flavor Journeys:</strong> Instead of one flavor, each tier offers a different taste experience, from <strong>chocolate fudge cake</strong> to light lemon elderflower.</li>
            <li><strong>Dessert Tables:</strong> Supplementing the main cake with <strong>gourmet dessert recipes</strong> like macarons, tartlets, and shooters for variety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unique Birthday Cake Ideas</h3>
        <p>For the <strong>best birthday cake ideas</strong>, personalization is key. <strong>Custom photo cakes</strong> are back in style with higher quality printing.

        <p>While vanilla and chocolate are timeless, the <strong>cake flavors people love</strong> are expanding. Palates are becoming more adventurous. Current favorites include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Salted Caramel:</strong> The perfect balance of sweet and salty.</li>

        <h3><a href="/how-to-store-cakes-properly" style="color: #E65A88; text-decoration: underline;">How to Store Cakes Properly</a></h3>
        <p>Nothing is worse than a dry, stale cake. Knowing <strong>how to store cakes properly</strong> is essential for maintaining that fresh-baked taste.</p>
        
        <h4>Unfrosted Cakes</h4>
        <p>Wrap layers tightly in plastic wrap. For best results, wrap them while they are still slightly warm (not hot!) to trap moisture, then freeze them. They can stay fresh in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h4>Frosted Cakes</h4>
        <p>Buttercream acts as a natural seal. A fully frosted cake can sit at room temperature for 2-3 days (unless it has a perishable filling like custard or fresh fruit). For longer storage, chill it in the fridge to set the frosting, then loosely wrap in plastic to prevent it from absorbing fridge odors.</p>

        <h4>Cut Cakes</h4>
        <p>Once cut, the exposed sponge will dry out quickly. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly against the cut surface, or use a slice of bread attached with toothpicks to "cap" the exposed area—the bread will dry out, but the cake will stay moist!</p>

        <p>Transitioning to <strong>gluten-free baking</strong> opens up a world of new textures and flavors. However, swapping out wheat flour isn't a 1:1 ratio. Understanding your flours is the first step to success.</p>
        
        <h3>Almond Flour</h3>
        <p>Made from blanched almonds, this flour adds incredible moisture and a nutty flavor. It's high in fat and low in carbs, making it perfect for <strong>keto baking</strong>. It works best in cakes, cookies, and tart crusts but lacks binding power, so it's often paired with egg whites or gums.</p>

        <h3>Coconut Flour</h3>
        <p>The sponge of the flour world! Coconut flour absorbs liquid like crazy. You generally only need 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coconut flour to replace 1 cup of regular flour, and you'll need significantly more eggs or liquid to prevent a dry, crumbly mess.</p>

        <h3>Oat Flour</h3>
        <p>A great whole-grain option that mimics the fluffiness of wheat flour. Certified <strong>gluten-free oat flour</strong> is essential for safety. It has a mild, sweet flavor ideal for pancakes, muffins, and quick breads.</p>`

        <p>Eggs serve multiple roles in baking: structure, leavening, and moisture. To replace them effectively, you need to match the substitute to the recipe.</p>

        <h3>1. Flax Eggs</h3>
        <p>Mix 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons warm water and let sit for 5 minutes. Best for: Cookies, muffins, and dense breads where a nutty flavor is welcome.</p>

        <h3>2. Applesauce</h3>
        <p>Use 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce per egg. Best for: Moist cakes and muffins. Reduce other liquids slightly to compensate.</p>

        <h3>3. Silken Tofu</h3>
        <p>Blend 1/4 cup silken tofu until smooth. Best for: Dense, moist bakes like brownies and pound cakes. It adds protein without altering the flavor.</p>

        <h3>4. Aquafaba</h3>
        <p>The liquid from a can of chickpeas! Whip it up to replace egg whites. Best for: Meringues, macarons, and adding lift to light cakes.</p>`

        <p>Not all non-dairy milks are created equal. The protein and fat content vary wildly, affecting your final bake.</p>

        <h3>Soy Milk</h3>
        <p>The gold standard for baking. Its high protein content allows it to curdle like buttermilk when mixed with vinegar, making it perfect for <strong>vegan red velvet cake</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Oat Milk</h3>
        <p>Creamy and sweet, oat milk promotes beautifully browning due to its sugar content. It's excellent in cookies and golden crusts.</p>

        <h3>Almond Milk</h3>
        <p>Light and often low-fat, it can sometimes result in drier cakes if not paired with added fats like oil or vegan butter. Use it in lighter, delicate sponges.</p>`

        <p>Gluten provides the elastic network that traps gas bubbles. Without it, we need new strategies to get that loft.</p>

        <h3>Hydration is Key</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free dough should be much wetter than traditional dough—more like a thick batter. Don't be tempted to add more flour; moisture is what creates the steam for lift.</p>

        <h3>The Power of Psyllium Husk</h3>
        <p>Xanthan gum is common, but <strong>psyllium husk powder</strong> is the game changer for bread. It creates a gel-like structure that allows the dough to be kneaded and shaped, providing that chewy, bread-like texture.</p>

        <h3>Longer Proofing</h3>
        <p>Give your yeast time and warmth. GF flours don't offer food for yeast as readily as wheat, so a warm, humid rising environment is crucial.</p>`

            <li><strong>Clean Equipment:</strong> Just like egg whites, any trace of grease will prevent whipping. Wipe your bowl with lemon juice.</li>
            <li><strong>Cream of Tartar:</strong> Essential for stabilizing the foam.</li>

        <p>Replace half the water in your recipe with cold vodka. Alcohol doesn't promote tough gluten formation (even in GF flours, over-hydration can be gummy) and it evaporates in the oven, leaving flaky layers behind.</p>

        <h3>Rolling Out</h3>
        <p>Never roll GF dough on a floured surface alone. Roll it between two sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to prevent sticking and breaking.</p>`

        <p>Vegan butter has come a long way, but it has a lower melting point than dairy butter. This can make piping tricky.</p>

        <h3>American Buttercream</h3>
        <p>Use a high-fat vegan butter stick (not tub margarine). Add a pinch of shortening to increase stability in warm weather.</p>

        <h3>Coconut Cream Frosting</h3>
        <p>For a less sweet option, whip chilled full-fat coconut milk. It's luscious and light, perfect for topping cupcakes or spice cakes.</p>

        <h3>Chocolate Ganache</h3>
        <p>Simply swap heavy cream for full-fat coconut milk or a plant-based cream alternative. Pour over cakes for a mirror glaze finish.</p>`

        <p>Even seasoned bakers stumble with GF baking. Here is how to avoid the pitfalls.</p>

        <h3>1. Measuring by Volume</h3>
        <p>GF flours settle more than wheat flour. Always <strong>weigh your ingredients</strong> in grams for accuracy. A cup of almond flour weighs very different from a cup of rice flour.</p>

        <h3>2. Skipping the Rest Period</h3>
        <p>GF batters need to rest for 15-30 minutes before baking. This hydrates the starches and prevents a gritty texture.</p>

        <h3>3. Over-mixing... or Under-mixing?</h3>
        <p>Unlike wheat batter, you can't really over-mix GF batter (no gluten to toughen!). In fact, mixing longer helps structure-building gums like xanthan gum to activate.</p>`
